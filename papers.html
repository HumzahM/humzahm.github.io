            <br>This is a summary of work I did, mostly from January to May of 2025, which analyzed different look-ahead bias mitigation 
                techniques and developed several methods to measure both harmfulness and helpfulness. Dr. Levy used this data in discussion 
                of entity neutering and look-ahead bias more generally.

            The UChicago Trading Competition is widely regarded as the top undergraduate trading competition and it attracts students
            from around the country. 
            This is my writeup of my winning solution for the research case of the 2025 competition.
            I had some clever optimizations I was proud of - especially 'capping' returns to maximize the sharpe ratio.
