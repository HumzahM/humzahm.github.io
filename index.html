        <p>I am a junior at UChicago, interested in research at the intersection of statistics, computer science, and finance.</p>
        <p>I like to take a human interpretable approach to everything I work on - always understanding <i>deeply</i>
            the problem I'm working on, why it matters, and <b>why a solution works.</b> </p>
            
        <p>I like to get things done and hustle (an appropriate amount.) 
            My favorite example is how I saved months of time deploying my webapp at Apollo by 
            cleverly finding a existing, unused ports rather than having to get a new one approved.
            I did crashed the production servers a few days later (doing something else) though I'm
            proud to say I was the only intern who crashed prod because I was the only intern on prod. </p>

        <h2>My Experiences:</h2>
            <h3>Research Assistant with Dr. Bradford Levy (Oct 2024 - Present)</h3>
            <h4>LLMs and Financial Data</h4>
                <figure>
                    <img src="booth.png" style="width:25%">
                </figure>
                <p>We are approaching a specific problem in the analysis of financial data with LLMs from the perspective of both finance and 
                    the underlying machine learning, though unfortunately I can't share more information publicly.</p>
            <h3>Apollo Global Management - SWE Intern (May 2024 - Aug 2024)</h3>
                <figure>
                    <img src="apollo.png" style="width:25%">
                </figure>
                <p>I spent most of the summer working on one large scale webapp.
                    The challenge wasn't technical as much as learning to push a project through demo -> dev -> production and learning to navigate 
                    the bureaucracies of a large organization. 
                </p>
            <h3>Research Assistant with Dr. Larry Harris (Oct 2023 - Mar 2024)</h3>
            <h4>Markets in "Event Time"</h4>
                <figure>
                    <img src="usc.jpg" style="width:25%">
                </figure>
                <p> I worked on testing some hypotheses related to explaining asset returns as functions of
                    trading volume. Though we didn't find what we were looking for,
                    I did learn a lot about markets and the process of academic research.
                </p>
            <h3>NASA Johnson Space Center (Jun 2022 - Aug 2022 and Jun 2023 - Aug 2023)</h3>
                <figure>

                </figure>
                <p>I spent two summers at NASA Johnson Space Center through a program called the Summer Robotics Academy.
                    The first summer I worked primarily on mechanical engineering tasks and the second summer I worked mostly on software related tasks. 
                    We also had a bomb squad inspired challenge between the interns my second summer - I was on the winning team.
