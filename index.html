    <p>I am a junior at UChicago, studying statistics and computer science. 
    I really enjoy doing work at the intersection of statistics, engineering/computer science, and finance.
    I find some of the problems there, including my research projects listed below, to be the perfect mix of intuitive enough that
    anyone can understand them and their implications while also being complex, challenging, and require creativity to solve. 
    If I'm not working I'm probably with friends or watching TV. Sometimes I'll make them watch TV with me.</p>
    <h2>My Experiences:</h2>
        <h3>LLMs in Finance Research with Dr. Bradford Levy (Oct 2024 - Present)</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="booth.png" style="width:25%">
            </figure>
            <p>Out of respect for Dr. Levy I won't share too much of the details of the current project online. My work is writing Python scripts
                to run LLMs on massive amounts of (financial) data and closely analyzing the output such as the conditional probabilities of tokens
                and other patterns. I'm really enjoying this project right now.
             </p>
             <p>
                <u>
                    What I'm learning so far: Working with big data. A lot more about LLMs and NLP. That I still really enjoy research.
                </u>

        <h3>Apollo Global Management - SWE Intern (May 2024 - Aug 2024)</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="apollo.png" style="width:25%">
                <figcaption>Unfortunately I can't find a screenshot of what I built on any of my personal devices</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>I spent most of the summer working on one large scale webapp.
                It was a website for one of the client teams to manage some large and complex email lists, including a maker-checker workflow and audit trail.
                It was the first Python webapp being built at Apollo ISG so I had to work with some senior team members to learn how to deploy it
                in the existing .NET enviroment. I also had to establish new tables in the database and figure out processes to safely interact with existing data.
             </p>
             <p>I was driven on this project knowing I was delivering actual value for Apollo. Without this every single
                change had to be ran be ran from client teams to dev teams to IT teams, done through SQL and tested in UAT before going into production.
                This was 2-3 man hours each and they had on average 5 or more requests a week. 
             </p>
            <p> <u>What I learned over the summer: How to navigate the bureaucracy of a large corporation to get things done. How to take a project from nothing to production. 
                    What its like to sit in an incident review meeting after you broke production while deploying.</u>

        <h3>Markets in "Event Time" Research with Dr. Larry Harris (Oct 2023 to Mar 2024)</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="event_time1.jpg" style="width:35%">
                <img src="event_time2.jpg" style="width:35%">
                <figcaption>Some of the dozens of figures I made</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p> Right now we think about markets in terms of equal chunks of calendar time - days, weeks, months, years.
                The project asked what if we looked at markets in terms of activity? For example, how do we split 30 years (360 calendar months) into 360 periods of equal event time?
                I enjoyed this project so much because we didn't have a "right" answer to this. We explored some various things:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Number of Trades - this has grown exponentially over time. At the same time trade size has gone down. We settled on using this with a 10 year front and back rolling average. </li>
                <li>Return Dispersion - we found this had a fairly high correlation with number of trades. However, RD has been affected by factors such as bid ask spreads becoming smaller over time.</li>
                <li>Volume - not a very good measure. Becomes extremely heavily weighted on times the market is doing better.</li>
            </ol>
            <p> The results were interesting though not too groundbreaking - the data becomes generally much less skewed, much more normal,
                and possibly also more efficent (for example, autocorrelation of returns was much lower).
            </p>
            <p> <u>What I learned: Python, Pandas, and much more about market microstructure. That I really enjoy research. That messy code leads to
                bad results and confusion and on my next project I need to have more discipline from day 1 and think about how everything will be scaled up
                after the prototyping phase. </u>

            <p>I spent two summers at NASA Johnson Space Center through a program called the Summer Robotics Academy,
                for graduating seniors on select FIRST Robotics Teams. After my first summer I asked to return and they kindly
                said yes. The first summer I worked primarily on mechanical engineering and design tasks using CAD. The second summer 
                I focused primarily on software related tasks. We also had a bomb squad inspired challenge my second summer - I was on the winning team.
            </p>
    <h3>Other: I don't really like having a public portfolio (and Linkedin) and I hope one day I'll be at a point where I can quietly take everything offline.</h3>
    <p>I'm grateful for every opportunity I've ever got and I recognize that a lot of people are struggling right now.
